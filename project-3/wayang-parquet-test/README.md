# Testing Parquet in Wayang

Some quick notes:
- To compile, you must have the following in your classpath:
  - Wayang jar files
  - Spark jar files
  - Hadoop jar files
- The folders to add to the classpath can be seen in the `.idea/libraries/jars.xml`.
  - Alternatively, see the code for the `wayang-submit` script
